# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
### Johns Hopkins University - offered through Coursera

This repository contains the final solution for peer-assessed programming assignment for the Getting and Cleaning Data course.

### Course Project

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### Running the script

* Clone this repository
* Download the data set and extract. It should result in a UCI HAR Dataset folder that has all the files in the required structure.
* Change current directory to the UCI HAR Dataset folder.
* Run Rscript run_analysis.R
* The tidy dataset should get created in the current directory as tidy_data_set.txt
* The tidy dataset with the averages should get created in the current directory as tidy_avgs_data_set.txt
